# Title: Interactive Quiz App Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

I developed an interactive quiz application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was a fantastic way to dive deep into web development, combining my skills in front-end technologies to create a dynamic and engaging user experience.

# Features
1.Question Display:

The quiz app presents a series of questions to the user. Each question is displayed one at a time, allowing the user to focus on the current question.

2.Answer Selection:

Users can select their answers from multiple choices. The app handles user input and ensures that only one answer can be selected per question.

3.Immediate Feedback:

After each answer submission, the app provides immediate feedback, indicating whether the selected answer was correct or incorrect. This feature helps users learn and stay engaged throughout the quiz.

4.Score Calculation:

The app keeps track of the user's score as they progress through the quiz. Points are awarded for each correct answer, motivating users to aim for a high score.

5.Final Score Display:

At the end of the quiz, the app displays the user's total score. This summary includes the number of correct and incorrect answers, providing a clear overview of the user's performance.
